EXAMPLE:
ALGORITHM MakeToast in JavaScript
// Purpose: Creates toast from bread using a toaster
// Input: bread (string), toasterSetting (number 1-5)
// Output: toast (object with properties: done, darkness level)

function makeToast(bread, toasterSetting) //takes bread and setting, returns finished toast
    const toaster = {}; //stores toaster state and properties
    const toast = {}; //stores the final toast object
    
    toaster.slot = bread; //place bread in toaster slot
    toaster.setting = toasterSetting; //set darkness level
    toaster.isToasting = true; //start toasting cycle
    toast.darkness = 0; //initialize darkness level at zero
    
    WHILE toaster.isToasting DO
        toast.darkness = toast.darkness + 1; //increment darkness level by 1
        IF toast.darkness >= toasterSetting THEN
            toaster.isToasting = false; //stop toasting when target reached
            popUp(toaster); //eject toast from toaster
        END IF
    END WHILE
    
    toast.done = true; //mark toast as complete
    
    return toast //returns finished toast object with darkness level
end function
